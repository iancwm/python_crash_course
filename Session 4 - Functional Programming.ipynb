Functions are a way of writing reusable code, which bring many benefits: \n","\n","1. **You don't have to repeat yourself**: Programmers are lazy. Anything that helps you be lazy is good.\n","2. **Less chances of errors**: Think of a function as a sub unit of a program. If that sub unit is proven to work, just use it rather than try to copy it all the time. If you write code to do the same thing in two areas, and you have to update the code in the first area, that means you need to remember to update the code in the second area.\n","3. **Easier to test and refactor**: When you know what goes in and what is supposed to come out of a function, you can focus on handling errors and improving efficiency in that function separate from the rest of the program.
